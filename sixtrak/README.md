Handcrafted non-volatile RAM snapshots initialized from MIDI SYSEX files.

Can be copied into nvram/sixtrak (for V11) or nvram/sixtrak_1 (for V9).
Remove the "-" and everything after it when copying. For example, `nvram_a-11.bin` becomes `nvram_a`.

V11:
* `nvram_a-11.bin`
* `nvram_b-11.bin`

V9:
* `nvram_a-9.bin`
* `nvram_b-9.bin`
